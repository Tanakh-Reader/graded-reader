The `apps.py` file is a configuration file for a Django application. It includes a default `AppConfig` class which you can extend to add any app-specific configurations. Some things you might include in an `apps.py` file could be:

1. **Custom Configuration**: This is useful if your application has specific settings that need to be configured, and you want to keep them organized with the rest of your application settings.

2. **Initialization Code**: If your application needs to run certain code when it starts up (for example, to initialize a cache or to set up a signal handler), you could add this code to the `ready` method of your `AppConfig` class.

3. **Registering signals**: Signals are a kind of hook provided by Django. They allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when certain actions have been taken. They're especially useful when you need to decouple modules of code that send (or "emit") notifications from code that receives (or "handles") them.
