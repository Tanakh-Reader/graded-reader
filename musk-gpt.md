## Readability Heuristics

Here are some ideas for metrics you can use to gauge the difficulty of a text:

1. **Word frequency**
   - Analyze the frequency of words in the text and compare them to a larger corpus. More frequent words tend to be easier, whereas rarer words can be more challenging.

2. **Morphological complexity**
   - Consider the complexity of the word forms in terms of inflection, derivation, or compounding. In the case of Hebrew, you may want to focus on prefixes, suffixes, and the complexity of the root system.

3. **Syntactic complexity**
   - Evaluate the complexity of sentence structures, such as the length of sentences, the use of subordination and coordination, and the presence of embedded clauses.

4. **Verb type**
   - Analyze the frequency and complexity of different verb types, such as weak and strong verbs, and their respective conjugations. You may also consider the use of different verb stems (binyanim) in Hebrew.

5. **Vocabulary diversity**
   - Measure the variety of unique words in a text, which can indicate a higher level of difficulty.

6. **Semantic complexity**
   - Assess the abstractness or concreteness of the concepts discussed in the text, as more abstract concepts can be harder to grasp.

7. **Text genre**
   - Identify the genre of the text, as certain genres like poetry or legal texts may inherently be more challenging due to their unique structures or vocabulary.

8. **Thematic familiarity**
   - Determine if the themes or subject matter of the text are familiar to the reader, as unfamiliar topics can make a text more difficult to understand.


Once you have these metrics, you can use machine learning algorithms or rule-based systems to assign difficulty scores to different texts, and then order them accordingly in your Django site


## Web Sockets

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a specification for asynchronous web servers, allowing them to serve applications that support non-blocking I/O operations. It is designed as an asynchronous counterpart to the synchronous WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) used in many traditional Django applications.

WebSockets, on the other hand, are a communication protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. Unlike the traditional request-response model used in HTTP, WebSockets enable both the client and server to send messages at any time, without waiting for a request from the other party.

Let's break down the architecture using diagrams:

**Traditional Django Architecture (WSGI, HTTP)**

```
    +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+
    |  Browser  | <-----> |   Django  | <-----> |  Database  |
    +-----------+   HTTP  +-----------+   SQL   +-----------+
     (Frontend)           (Web server)
```

In a traditional Django architecture using WSGI and HTTP, the browser (frontend) communicates with the Django web server (backend) through HTTP requests and responses. The Django server processes these requests, communicates with the database (if needed), and returns the response to the browser.

**Django Channels Architecture (ASGI, WebSockets)**

```
    +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+
    |  Browser  | <-----> | Channels  | <-----> |   Django  | <-----> |  Database  |
    +-----------+ WebSocket +-----------+   ASGI  +-----------+   SQL   +-----------+
     (Frontend)           (ASGI server)          (Web server)
```

In a Django Channels architecture using ASGI and WebSockets, the browser (frontend) communicates with the Channels ASGI server through a WebSocket connection. This allows for bidirectional, real-time communication between the browser and the server. The ASGI server interacts with the Django web server, which can still communicate with the database using SQL queries.

The main difference between these architectures is the way the client (browser) and server communicate. With WebSockets, the connection remains open, enabling real-time communication, while the traditional HTTP-based approach relies on individual requests and responses.

Here's a high-level overview of the flow:

1. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the Django Channels ASGI server.
2. The ASGI server handles incoming WebSocket messages and dispatches them to the appropriate consumer (a WebSocket consumer in this case).
3. The consumer processes the messages and communicates with the Django web server and the database if necessary.
4. When the `add_words_to_database` function finishes loading words into the database, it sends a message through the WebSocket to the frontend.
5. The frontend receives the message and refreshes the page.

This architecture enables real-time communication between the frontend and backend, making it suitable for applications that require live updates and instantaneous interactions.

Certainly! Here's an outline of the changes you would need to make in your Django application to use Django Channels and WebSockets:

1. Create a WebSocket consumer:

In your Django app, create a new file named `consumers.py`. Inside this file, create a WebSocket consumer that listens for messages from the server:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer
import json

class WordsLoadedConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        pass

    async def words_loaded(self, event):
        await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({'words_loaded': True}))
```

2. Modify the `add_words_to_database` function:

Update your `add_words_to_database` function to send a message through the WebSocket when the words are loaded. First, import the necessary functions:

```python
from channels.layers import get_channel_layer
from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync
```

Then, at the end of the `add_words_to_database` function, add the following code to send a message:

```python
channel_layer = get_channel_layer()
async_to_sync(channel_layer.group_send)(
    'words_loaded', {
        'type': 'words_loaded',
    }
)
```

3. Set up routing for the WebSocket consumer:

Create a new file named `routing.py` in your Django app. Inside this file, define the WebSocket routing:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import consumers

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    path('ws/words_loaded/', consumers.WordsLoadedConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

4. Update your Django project settings:

In your Django project's `settings.py` file, add the following code to configure the Channels layer:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps ...
    'channels',
]

# Channels settings
ASGI_APPLICATION = '<your_project_name>.asgi.application'

CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer',
    },
}
```

Replace `<your_project_name>` with the name of your Django project.

5. Update your `read.html` template:

In your `read.html` file, add the following JavaScript code inside a `<script>` tag:

```html
{% if not words_loaded %}
<script>
  var socket = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/ws/words_loaded/');

  socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.words_loaded) {
      location.reload();
    }
  };

  socket.onclose = function(event) {
    console.error('WebSocket closed unexpectedly');
  };
</script>
{% endif %}
```

This JavaScript code establishes a WebSocket connection to the server, listens for messages indicating that the words are loaded, and refreshes the page when the words are loaded.

With these changes in place, your Django app should now use Django Channels and WebSockets to refresh the page when the words are loaded into the database. Remember that this outline assumes that you've already installed and set up Django Channels, the ASGI server, and any additional dependencies.

## De-coupling Code // Design

I appreciate your thought process and your goal of having clean, well-organized, loosely coupled code without investing time in learning complex new libraries. Here are a few suggestions that might help you achieve that:

1. Organize JavaScript code into modules: Organize your JavaScript code into separate modules based on functionality. For example, you could have a module for handling AJAX calls, another for UI interactions, and another for utility functions. This will help you separate concerns and make your code more maintainable.

2. Use a Pub/Sub pattern: Implement a Publish-Subscribe pattern in your JavaScript code. This allows different parts of your application to communicate with each other without being tightly coupled. When something important happens, like the completion of an API call, you can publish an event, and other parts of the code can subscribe to that event and react accordingly.

3. Avoid hardcoding element IDs and class names: Instead of hardcoding element IDs and class names in your JavaScript code, consider using data attributes to associate the elements with specific actions or data. This will make your code more flexible and easier to maintain.

4. Encapsulate related logic in functions or classes: Group related functionality together by encapsulating it in functions or classes. This will make your code more modular, easier to understand, and easier to maintain.

5. Leverage Django template inheritance: Make use of Django template inheritance to create reusable base templates and include them in different pages. This will help you avoid duplicating code and make your templates more modular.

6. Use Django's built-in functionality for AJAX: Django has built-in support for handling AJAX requests. Instead of using jQuery, you can use Django views and JsonResponse to handle AJAX calls, which will make your code more consistent and easier to maintain.

7. Consider using a lightweight front-end framework: While you mentioned not wanting to learn complex new libraries, consider using a lightweight front-end framework like Alpine.js. It's designed to be easy to learn and integrate into existing projects. Alpine.js can help you with state management and UI interactions, allowing you to write cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Expanded

1. Utilize JavaScript modules:

JavaScript modules allow you to organize and structure your code into separate, reusable pieces. Modules help you maintain a clean codebase, improve code reusability, and avoid naming collisions.

To start using JavaScript modules, you can create separate files for each module, and then use the `import` and `export` keywords to share code between modules. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following code for handling passages:

```javascript
// passages.js
export function getHebrewText(passageId, divNumber) {
  // ...
}

export function isReferenceMatch(searchTerm, reference) {
  // ...
}

export function selectPassage(event) {
  // ...
}
```

You can import these functions in another JavaScript file and use them as needed:

```javascript
// main.js
import { getHebrewText, isReferenceMatch, selectPassage } from './passages.js';

getHebrewText(1, 1);
```

To use JavaScript modules in your HTML, you need to specify the `type="module"` attribute on your script tag:

```html
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
```

By using JavaScript modules, you can keep your code organized and maintainable. It will help you avoid having a single large JavaScript file with all your code mixed together.

Keep in mind that JavaScript modules are supported in modern browsers, but you may need a build tool like webpack or Rollup if you need to support older browsers or want to use advanced features like tree shaking or code splitting. 2 and 3:

2. Use a Pub/Sub pattern:

The Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern is a messaging pattern that allows different parts of your application to communicate with each other without being tightly coupled. In the Pub/Sub pattern, components can publish messages (events) without needing to know which components are interested in those events. Other components can subscribe to specific events and react to them when they are triggered.

In JavaScript, you can implement the Pub/Sub pattern using the CustomEvent API or a simple EventEmitter class. Here's a basic example using the CustomEvent API:

```javascript
// Create and dispatch a custom event
function publish(eventName, detail) {
  const event = new CustomEvent(eventName, { detail: detail });
  document.dispatchEvent(event);
}

// Subscribe to a custom event
function subscribe(eventName, callback) {
  document.addEventListener(eventName, callback);
}

// Usage:
subscribe('hebrewTextLoaded', (event) => {
  console.log('Hebrew text loaded:', event.detail.passageId);
});

publish('hebrewTextLoaded', { passageId: 123 });
```

Using the Pub/Sub pattern, your components can react to events without knowing the specifics of how the event is generated. This promotes loose coupling and makes your code more maintainable.

3. Avoid hardcoding element IDs and class names:

Hardcoding element IDs and class names in your JavaScript code can make it less flexible and harder to maintain. If you decide to change the structure or styling of your HTML, you may need to update your JavaScript code as well. To avoid this issue, you can use data attributes to associate elements with specific actions or data.

For example, instead of using an element ID to find and update the content of a passage:

```javascript
$('#passage-text' + divNumber).html(response.html);
```

You can use a data attribute to associate the passage element with a specific passage ID:

```html
<div data-passage-id="{{ forloop.counter }}" class="passage-text"></div>
```

Then, in your JavaScript code, you can use the data attribute to find the appropriate element:

```javascript
$(`[data-passage-id="${divNumber}"]`).html(response.html);
```

By using data attributes, you make your code more flexible and less dependent on specific element IDs or class names. This will help you achieve a more loosely coupled and maintainable codebase.


5. Leverage Django template inheritance:

Django template inheritance enables you to create a base template that serves as a foundation for other templates, so you don't need to repeat common elements (like the header, navigation, or footer) across your templates. This approach will keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and make it easier to maintain and update.

To leverage Django template inheritance, follow these steps:

1. Create a base template (e.g., `base.html`) that includes the common elements and layout structure. Use the `{% block %}` tag to define placeholders for the content that will be provided by the child templates.

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Common head elements -->
  {% block extra_head %}{% endblock %}
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <!-- Common header content -->
  </header>

  <main>
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </main>

  <footer>
    <!-- Common footer content -->
  </footer>

  <!-- Common JavaScript -->
  {% block extra_js %}{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>
```

2. In your other templates, extend the base template using the `{% extends %}` tag and provide content for the `{% block %}` placeholders.

```html
<!-- your_template.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block extra_head %}
  <!-- Additional head elements for this specific template -->
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <!-- Main content for this specific template -->
{% endblock %}

{% block extra_js %}
  <!-- Additional JavaScript for this specific template -->
{% endblock %}
```

By using Django template inheritance, you can maintain a consistent structure and layout across your templates, making your code more organized and easier to maintain. You can also easily update shared elements in one place (the base template), and the changes will be applied to all templates that extend it.

7. [ALPINE JS](https://alpinejs.dev/)

Alpine.js can help decouple your Hebrew app code by handling UI interactions and state management more efficiently. Here are some examples of how you can use Alpine.js in your Hebrew app:

1. **Dropdown menu**: Instead of using JavaScript to manage the dropdown menu's visibility and interaction, you can use Alpine.js directives to handle the show/hide logic and event handling.

```html
<div x-data="{ open: false }" @click.away="open = false">
    <button @click="open = !open" class="border rounded p-2">{{ text_passage.reference }}</button>
    <div x-show="open" class="absolute z-10 mt-1 w-full bg-white shadow-md border rounded overflow-auto max-h-48">
        <!-- Rest of the dropdown code -->
    </div>
</div>
```

2. **Filtering dropdown items**: Instead of using a separate `filterDropdown()` function, you can use Alpine.js to manage the filtering logic. This can be done by introducing a state variable to store the search input and using a computed property to filter the items based on the input.

```html
<div x-data="{ searchTerm: '', passages: [/*... your passages list ...*/] }">
    <input x-model="searchTerm" type="text" class="border-b w-full p-2" placeholder="Search...">
    <ul class="list-none p-0">
        <template x-for="passage in filteredPassages" :key="passage.id">
            <li @click="selectPassage(passage)" class="p-2 hover:bg-gray-200 cursor-pointer">{{ passage.reference }} {{ passage.penalty }}</li>
        </template>
    </ul>
    <script>
        function filteredPassages() {
            return this.passages.filter(passage => isReferenceMatch(this.searchTerm, passage.reference));
        }
    </script>
</div>
```

3. **Loading Hebrew text**: You can use Alpine.js to fetch and render the Hebrew text when a passage is selected. This can be achieved by adding a method to the Alpine.js component and calling it on click.

```html
<div x-data="{ ... }" @hebrew-text-loaded.window="handleHebrewTextLoaded($event)">
    <!-- Rest of the code -->
</div>
<script>
    function handleHebrewTextLoaded(event) {
        // Update the appropriate element with the loaded Hebrew text
    }
</script>
```

These examples demonstrate how Alpine.js can help you manage UI interactions and state more efficiently, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
