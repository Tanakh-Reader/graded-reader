Here are some ideas for metrics you can use to gauge the difficulty of a text:

1. **Word frequency**
   - Analyze the frequency of words in the text and compare them to a larger corpus. More frequent words tend to be easier, whereas rarer words can be more challenging.

2. **Morphological complexity**
   - Consider the complexity of the word forms in terms of inflection, derivation, or compounding. In the case of Hebrew, you may want to focus on prefixes, suffixes, and the complexity of the root system.

3. **Syntactic complexity**
   - Evaluate the complexity of sentence structures, such as the length of sentences, the use of subordination and coordination, and the presence of embedded clauses.

4. **Verb type**
   - Analyze the frequency and complexity of different verb types, such as weak and strong verbs, and their respective conjugations. You may also consider the use of different verb stems (binyanim) in Hebrew.

5. **Vocabulary diversity**
   - Measure the variety of unique words in a text, which can indicate a higher level of difficulty.

6. **Semantic complexity**
   - Assess the abstractness or concreteness of the concepts discussed in the text, as more abstract concepts can be harder to grasp.

7. **Text genre**
   - Identify the genre of the text, as certain genres like poetry or legal texts may inherently be more challenging due to their unique structures or vocabulary.

8. **Thematic familiarity**
   - Determine if the themes or subject matter of the text are familiar to the reader, as unfamiliar topics can make a text more difficult to understand.


Once you have these metrics, you can use machine learning algorithms or rule-based systems to assign difficulty scores to different texts, and then order them accordingly in your Django site
