Here are some ideas for metrics you can use to gauge the difficulty of a text:

1. **Word frequency**
   - Analyze the frequency of words in the text and compare them to a larger corpus. More frequent words tend to be easier, whereas rarer words can be more challenging.

2. **Morphological complexity**
   - Consider the complexity of the word forms in terms of inflection, derivation, or compounding. In the case of Hebrew, you may want to focus on prefixes, suffixes, and the complexity of the root system.

3. **Syntactic complexity**
   - Evaluate the complexity of sentence structures, such as the length of sentences, the use of subordination and coordination, and the presence of embedded clauses.

4. **Verb type**
   - Analyze the frequency and complexity of different verb types, such as weak and strong verbs, and their respective conjugations. You may also consider the use of different verb stems (binyanim) in Hebrew.

5. **Vocabulary diversity**
   - Measure the variety of unique words in a text, which can indicate a higher level of difficulty.

6. **Semantic complexity**
   - Assess the abstractness or concreteness of the concepts discussed in the text, as more abstract concepts can be harder to grasp.

7. **Text genre**
   - Identify the genre of the text, as certain genres like poetry or legal texts may inherently be more challenging due to their unique structures or vocabulary.

8. **Thematic familiarity**
   - Determine if the themes or subject matter of the text are familiar to the reader, as unfamiliar topics can make a text more difficult to understand.


Once you have these metrics, you can use machine learning algorithms or rule-based systems to assign difficulty scores to different texts, and then order them accordingly in your Django site


## Web Sockets

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a specification for asynchronous web servers, allowing them to serve applications that support non-blocking I/O operations. It is designed as an asynchronous counterpart to the synchronous WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) used in many traditional Django applications.

WebSockets, on the other hand, are a communication protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. Unlike the traditional request-response model used in HTTP, WebSockets enable both the client and server to send messages at any time, without waiting for a request from the other party.

Let's break down the architecture using diagrams:

**Traditional Django Architecture (WSGI, HTTP)**

```
    +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+
    |  Browser  | <-----> |   Django  | <-----> |  Database  |
    +-----------+   HTTP  +-----------+   SQL   +-----------+
     (Frontend)           (Web server)
```

In a traditional Django architecture using WSGI and HTTP, the browser (frontend) communicates with the Django web server (backend) through HTTP requests and responses. The Django server processes these requests, communicates with the database (if needed), and returns the response to the browser.

**Django Channels Architecture (ASGI, WebSockets)**

```
    +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+         +-----------+
    |  Browser  | <-----> | Channels  | <-----> |   Django  | <-----> |  Database  |
    +-----------+ WebSocket +-----------+   ASGI  +-----------+   SQL   +-----------+
     (Frontend)           (ASGI server)          (Web server)
```

In a Django Channels architecture using ASGI and WebSockets, the browser (frontend) communicates with the Channels ASGI server through a WebSocket connection. This allows for bidirectional, real-time communication between the browser and the server. The ASGI server interacts with the Django web server, which can still communicate with the database using SQL queries.

The main difference between these architectures is the way the client (browser) and server communicate. With WebSockets, the connection remains open, enabling real-time communication, while the traditional HTTP-based approach relies on individual requests and responses.

Here's a high-level overview of the flow:

1. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the Django Channels ASGI server.
2. The ASGI server handles incoming WebSocket messages and dispatches them to the appropriate consumer (a WebSocket consumer in this case).
3. The consumer processes the messages and communicates with the Django web server and the database if necessary.
4. When the `add_words_to_database` function finishes loading words into the database, it sends a message through the WebSocket to the frontend.
5. The frontend receives the message and refreshes the page.

This architecture enables real-time communication between the frontend and backend, making it suitable for applications that require live updates and instantaneous interactions.

Certainly! Here's an outline of the changes you would need to make in your Django application to use Django Channels and WebSockets:

1. Create a WebSocket consumer:

In your Django app, create a new file named `consumers.py`. Inside this file, create a WebSocket consumer that listens for messages from the server:

```python
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer
import json

class WordsLoadedConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        await self.accept()

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        pass

    async def words_loaded(self, event):
        await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({'words_loaded': True}))
```

2. Modify the `add_words_to_database` function:

Update your `add_words_to_database` function to send a message through the WebSocket when the words are loaded. First, import the necessary functions:

```python
from channels.layers import get_channel_layer
from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync
```

Then, at the end of the `add_words_to_database` function, add the following code to send a message:

```python
channel_layer = get_channel_layer()
async_to_sync(channel_layer.group_send)(
    'words_loaded', {
        'type': 'words_loaded',
    }
)
```

3. Set up routing for the WebSocket consumer:

Create a new file named `routing.py` in your Django app. Inside this file, define the WebSocket routing:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import consumers

websocket_urlpatterns = [
    path('ws/words_loaded/', consumers.WordsLoadedConsumer.as_asgi()),
]
```

4. Update your Django project settings:

In your Django project's `settings.py` file, add the following code to configure the Channels layer:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps ...
    'channels',
]

# Channels settings
ASGI_APPLICATION = '<your_project_name>.asgi.application'

CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer',
    },
}
```

Replace `<your_project_name>` with the name of your Django project.

5. Update your `read.html` template:

In your `read.html` file, add the following JavaScript code inside a `<script>` tag:

```html
{% if not words_loaded %}
<script>
  var socket = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/ws/words_loaded/');

  socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    var data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.words_loaded) {
      location.reload();
    }
  };

  socket.onclose = function(event) {
    console.error('WebSocket closed unexpectedly');
  };
</script>
{% endif %}
```

This JavaScript code establishes a WebSocket connection to the server, listens for messages indicating that the words are loaded, and refreshes the page when the words are loaded.

With these changes in place, your Django app should now use Django Channels and WebSockets to refresh the page when the words are loaded into the database. Remember that this outline assumes that you've already installed and set up Django Channels, the ASGI server, and any additional dependencies.
